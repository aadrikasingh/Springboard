# 1. Flight delay prediction
## Project Description 
Using historical on-time performance and weather data to predict whether the arrival of a scheduled passenger flight will be delayed by more than 15 minutes or not.
## Who's this for?
•	Passengers (to be prepared for the disruption of their journey)

•	Airlines (to pro-actively respond to the potential causes of the flight delay to mitigate their impact)
## Data Set Description
• On-time performance data : Passenger flight on-time performance data taken from TranStats data collection from [here](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time).

• Weather data : The weather data represents observations from airport weather stations, taken from [here](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/orders/qclcd/).
# 2. Predicting customer churn
## Project Description 
The idea is to build a model that predicts the propensity of customers to churn (are most likely to leave). Customer churn includes customers stopping the use of a service, switching to a competitor service, switching to a lower-tier experience in the service or reducing engagement with the service.
## Who's this for?
Industries, particularly telecommunication industries (to understand which factors cause customers to stop using their service).
## Data Set Description
• [Train Data](http://www.kdd.org/cupfiles/KDDCupData/2009/orange_small_train.data.zip)

• [Test Data](http://www.kdd.org/cupfiles/KDDCupData/2009/orange_small_test.data.zip)

• [Train Churn Labels](http://www.kdd.org/cupfiles/KDDCupData/2009/files/orange_small_train_churn.labels)
# 3. Retail Forecasting
## Project Description
The idea is to use historical sales data, and use regression and time - analysis techniques to predict future sales for the business.
## Who's this for?
Retail businesses (for inventory planning, product pricing, promotion, and placement)
## Data Set Description
